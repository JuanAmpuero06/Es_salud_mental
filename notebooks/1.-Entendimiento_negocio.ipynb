    "# Business Objectives\n",
    "- **Develop a predictive model** that identifies individuals at high risk of suicide based on patterns and risk factors present in mental health data.\n",
    "- **Provide analytical tools** that facilitate the early detection of suicide risk, helping mental health professionals to intervene in a timely manner.\n",
    "- **Improve the effectiveness of clinical interventions** by using data-driven predictions, reducing workload, and increasing accuracy in identifying critical cases.\n",
    "- **Contribute to public health** by supporting efforts to reduce suicide rates through the implementation of predictive systems in clinical and community settings.\n"

    "    - Analysis and processing of existing mental health data.  \n",
    "    - Development and evaluation of predictive models using machine learning techniques.  \n",
    "    - Implementation of an early warning system based on predictions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Out of Scope:**  \n",
    "    - Collection of new data.  \n",
    "    - Direct intervention with individuals at risk (the project focuses on prediction, not intervention).  \n",
    "    - Clinical evaluation of models in real-world settings (this could be a future phase of the project).\n"

    "# Success Criteria\n",
    "- **Model Accuracy:** The predictive model must achieve at least 80% accuracy in identifying individuals at high risk of suicide.\n",
    "- **Implementability:** The system must be easily integrable into the existing technological platforms used by mental health professionals.\n",
    "- **Social Impact:** The project must demonstrate potential for a positive impact in reducing the incidence of suicides.\n"
