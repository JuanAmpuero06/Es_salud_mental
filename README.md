# Suicide Risk Prediction Project

The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model based on data from the Starcraft II video game, which will allow predicting player performance. This will be achieved by analyzing various player variables, such as hours played per week (HoursPerWeek), actions per minute (APM), league level (LeagueIndex), and other relevant characteristics. This analysis will seek to provide insights that can help improve player performance, optimize gameplay, and also create effective strategies to enhance the player experience.

CRISP-DM Methodology: To carry out this project, the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology will be used, one of the most popular and comprehensive methodologies for data mining and machine learning projects.
